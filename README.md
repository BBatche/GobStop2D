# GobStop2D
2D side scroller game where the objective is to collect gobs at each "checkpoint" in order to please the Evil Professor. 
The goal is to complete all 10 miniature levels to grab the trophy and clear the stage. The Evil Professor periodically throws gobs at the player to remind them to buy gobs.
The player must avoid traps and the gobs in order to clear each level.
